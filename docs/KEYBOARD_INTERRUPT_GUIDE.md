# ⌨️ Keyboard Interrupt Handling Guide

## ✅ Comprehensive Ctrl+C Handling Implemented

Your Market Price Tracker now handles keyboard interrupts (Ctrl+C) gracefully at all levels of the application!

---

## 🛡️ Protection Levels

### 1. Application Level (main_enhanced.py)
**What happens when you press Ctrl+C:**

#### During Login/Registration
- ⚠️ Shows: "Operation interrupted"
- ❓ Asks: "Exit application?"
- ✓ Yes → Clean exit with goodbye message
- ✗ No → Returns to login menu

#### While Authenticated (in any menu)
- ⚠️ Shows: "Operation interrupted"
- ❓ Asks: "Logout and exit?"
- ✓ Yes → Logs out, closes database, exits gracefully
- ✗ No → Returns to your current menu

#### At Main Function Level
- ⚠️ Shows: "Application terminated by user"
- 👋 Displays: "Thank you for using Market Price Tracker!"
- 🗄️ Closes: Database connection automatically
- ✓ Clean exit with status code 0

## 🎯 UI Input Protection (src/ui.py)

### get_input() Method
**Before:**
```python
value = input("Enter something: ")  # Could hang on Ctrl+C
```

**Now:**
```python
try:
    value = input("Enter something: ")
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("\n")
    UI.print_warning("Input cancelled")
    raise  # Pass to higher level handler
```

**Behavior:**
- Catches Ctrl+C during any input prompt
- Shows: "⚠️ Input cancelled"
- Raises exception to be handled by menu context

---

### confirm() Method
**Before:**
```python
response = input("Confirm? (y/n): ")  # No protection
```

**Now:**
```python
try:
    response = input("Confirm? (y/n): ")
    return response in ['y', 'yes']
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("\n")
    UI.print_warning("Confirmation cancelled")
    return False  # Default to "no"
```

**Behavior:**
- Catches Ctrl+C during confirmation
- Shows: "⚠️ Confirmation cancelled"
- Returns `False` (safe default)
- No exception raised → continues flow

---

### pause() Method
**Before:**
```python
input("Press Enter to continue...")  # Vulnerable
```

**Now:**
```python
try:
    input("Press Enter to continue...")
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("\n")
    pass  # Just continue silently
```

**Behavior:**
- Catches Ctrl+C during pause
- Continues silently
- No error message (not critical)

```

---

### Scenario 3: Interrupt During Confirmation
```bash
# Try to delete a user
Are you sure you want to delete this user? (y/n): [Ctrl+C]

Expected Output:
⚠️ Confirmation cancelled
# Operation cancelled, user not deleted
Press Enter to continue...
```

---

### Scenario 4: Interrupt at Main Menu
```bash

## 🔍 How It Works

### Control Flow
```
User presses Ctrl+C

Input function catches KeyboardInterrupt
     ↓
Shows context-appropriate message
     ↓
Either:
  - Raises to parent (get_input)
  - Returns safe default (confirm)
  - Continues silently (pause)
     ↓
Parent menu catches exception
     ↓
